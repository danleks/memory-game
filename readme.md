### Rules of Memory Game

- Player starts by flipping over one card
- If the next card player flips matches, a pop up alert notifies the player and the player gets +1 to the score
- These cards do not disspear
- If the next card the player flips does not match, a pop up alert notifies the player of this and the cards flip back
- The game continues until the player matches all the cards on the board
